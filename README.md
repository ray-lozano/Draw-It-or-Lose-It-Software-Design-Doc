# Draw-It-or-Lose-It-Software-Design-Doc
Design document for The Gaming Room game Draw It or Lose It

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is a video game company that has created the Android app Draw It or Lose It. The software they want designed is Draw It or Lose It but on multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I felt like I did ample research on the Development Requirements section of the documentation. Researching the various Operating Systems, their pros and cons, as well as addressing the required knowledge for development on each platform.

**What about the process of working through a design documentation did you find helpful when developing the code?**
The UML diagram was the perhaps the most useful when developing the code. Looking at each of the methods made it easier to understand what was required for the code development.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would choose to revise the Recommendations section. I feel like some points are weaker than others like the Operating Systems Architectures, Distributed Systems and Networks, and maybe the Security section.

**How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?**
My interpretation of the user's needs is, they need their app developed on multiple platforms, so my job is to development that app based on the operating system. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the ones who chose to spend their money on the development team. They also are wanting to ensure that they retain customer satisfaction for their playerbase.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
My approach for designing software is to ask the question, What does it need to do? After that comes the note taking of the specifics behind the software, like what programming language will it need to be in, or the operating system requirements. When designing similar software applications in the future, some of the knowledge from previous projects will already aid me and potentially make development a bit smoother.
